Jimmy Chu's professional journey began in the realms of full-stack development and DevOps engineering,
where he honed his technical acumen. Soon, convinced of blockchain's potential to revolutionize
the digital landscape and fascinated by its underlying cryptographic principles, Jimmy immersed
himself in the Polkadot ecosystem, leveraging Substrate to craft a series of prototypes. His
expertise further expanded when working in a startup that create a layer 2 solution integrating
blockchains in the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems. Currently, he is delving into the intricacies
of zero-knowledge proofs, endeavoring to balance his passion for coding, building, and continuous
learning within this cutting-edge technological frontier.

Jimmy Chu started as a full-stack developer and devOps engineer, but soon captivated by blockchain
technology and its cryptographic theory behind, believing blockchain will be the next wave of
technology disruption. He worked in the Polkadot ecosystem and used Substrate extensively to
build various prototypes. He also worked in a startup that build a layer 2 solution bridging
Polkadot and Ethereum world together. Currently he is experimenting with zero-knowledge proof.
He is trying to find a sweet spot at the intersection of writing code, building things, and learning.
