I am interested in web3 and cryptographic development, currently focusing on subject of programmable cryptography. Excited about building services and applications that honor user privacy and are cryptographically unbreakable or very costly to break. Wish the world would become freer and more democratic as human civilization advances.

## Work/Projects completed 

In 2025 Q2, implemented **Analytics dApp built on Zama fhEVM**. This analytics dApp leverages fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE scheme), using fhEVM library, to encrypt respondent answers and perform aggregate analysis. The project is in response to Zama Bounty [Build a Confidential Benchmarking and Polling System Onchain using fhEVM](https://github.com/zama-ai/bounty-program/issues/144).

In 2025 Q1, delivered **Anonymous Multi-sig wallet with Semaphore MSA Modules**. The project uses Semahore protocol to generate a zero-knowledge proof to represent a member endorsement on a transaction within a group. The project is supported by [PSE grant](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/72) / [Ethereum Foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/06/allocation-q4-24#:~:text=Semaphore%20Modular%20Smart%20Contract%20Validator%20Module).

In 2024 Q3, completed [**PSE Core Program**](https://pse.dev/en/programs) to gain a deeper understanding on Programmable Cryptography. At the end of the program, delivered a capstone project [**Number Guessing Game**](https://github.com/jimmychu0807/number-guessing-game), a game that awards player making a guess closest to participants' mean, using zero-knowledge proof written with circom toolchain.
