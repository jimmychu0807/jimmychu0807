I am passionate about Web3 and cryptographic development, with a current focus on programmable cryptography — including zero-knowledge proofs (zk), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC) — at both theoretical and practical levels. I am excited by the challenge of building services and applications that prioritize user privacy and employ robust, cryptographically secure architectures. I envision a future where technology empowers a freer, more democratic society as human civilization evolves.

## Project experience

- In 2025 Q3, participated in [**Ethereum Protcol Fellowship - Cohort 6**](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/04/10/epf-6), and integrated zkVM Brevis Pico into Ethereum Client [Grandine](https://github.com/grandinetech/grandine) to benchmark Ethereum state transition function.

  - [Main Grandine integration PR](https://github.com/grandinetech/grandine/pull/386).
  - Accompanied PRs on [bls12_381](https://github.com/grandinetech/universal-precompiles/pull/4) and [sha256](https://github.com/grandinetech/universal-precompiles/pull/3).

  *Key skills*: zkVM ([Brevis Pico](https://docs.brevis.network/), RiscZero VM, Succinct SP1), Ethereum client (Grandine, Ream), Ethereum spec &
testing process ([consensus-specs](https://ethereum.github.io/consensus-specs/), [execution-specs](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/), [Kurtosis ethereum package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package)), Rust

- In 2025 Q2, implemented **Analytics dApp built on Zama fhEVM**. This analytics dApp leverages fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE scheme), using [fhEVM](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm) library, to encrypt respondent answers and perform aggregate analysis. The project was submitted to [Zama Bounty Season 8](https://github.com/zama-ai/bounty-program/issues/144) and **won 2nd-place**.

  *Key skills*: TFHE, fhEVM, Solidity, Hardhat, React, Next.js

- In 2025 Q1, delivered **Anonymous Multi-sig wallet with Semaphore Smart Account Modules**. This project utilizes the [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev) protocol to generate zero-knowledge proofs, enabling group members to endorse transactions while preserving anonymity. The initiative was granted by [PSE Acceleration Program grant](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/72) / [Ethereum Foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/06/allocation-q4-24#:~:text=Semaphore%20Modular%20Smart%20Contract%20Validator%20Module).

  *Key skills*: zero-knowledge, Semaphore, Solidity, Foundry, [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/), [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/), Rhinestone [modulekit](https://docs.rhinestone.dev/build-modules/overview), Pimlico permissionless, React, next.js

- In 2024 Q3, completed [**PSE Core Program**](https://pse.dev/en/programs) to gain a deeper understanding on programmable cryptography. At the end of the program, delivered capstone project **Number Guessing Game**, a game that awards player making a guess closest to participants' mean, using zero-knowledge proof written with circom toolchain.
