I am passionate about Web3 and cryptographic development, with a current focus on programmable cryptography ‚Äî including zero-knowledge proofs (zk), fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC) ‚Äî at both theoretical and practical levels. I am excited by the challenge of building services and applications that prioritize user privacy and employ robust, cryptographically secure architectures. I envision a future where technology empowers a freer, more democratic society as human civilization evolves.

## Key technical skills

Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, zk-SNARKs, Circom, Semaphore, FHE, TFHE, TypeScript, Next.js, React, ERC-4337 Account Abstraction, Rust.

## Project experience

- In 2025 Q2, implemented **Analytics dApp built on Zama fhEVM**. This analytics dApp leverages fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE scheme), using [fhEVM](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm) library, to encrypt respondent answers and perform aggregate analysis. The project was submitted to [Zama Bounty Season 8](https://github.com/zama-ai/bounty-program/issues/144) and **won 2nd-place**.

  *Key skills*: TFHE, fhEVM, Solidity, Hardhat, React, Next.js

- In 2025 Q1, delivered **Anonymous Multi-sig wallet with Semaphore Smart Account Modules**. This project utilizes the [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev) protocol to generate zero-knowledge proofs, enabling group members to endorse transactions while preserving anonymity. The initiative was granted by [PSE Acceleration Program grant](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/acceleration-program/issues/72) / [Ethereum Foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/06/allocation-q4-24#:~:text=Semaphore%20Modular%20Smart%20Contract%20Validator%20Module).

- In 2024 Q3, completed [**PSE Core Program**](https://pse.dev/en/programs) to gain a deeper understanding on programmable cryptography. At the end of the program, delivered capstone project **Number Guessing Game**, a game that awards player making a guess closest to participants' mean, using zero-knowledge proof written with circom toolchain.
